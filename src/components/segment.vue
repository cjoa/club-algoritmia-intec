<!-- * Represents a logic section of the website, is much like the <section>
     * tag  but with a few addons like the ability to add parallax images 
     * with an attribute, should support text formatted in a specific way
     * (like how the text is going to be centered, font-sizes, etc...) and
     * inner html.
     * -->

<!-- * TODO: Complete the segment component as the description says,
     * or add what you want and see fit to the component. -->
