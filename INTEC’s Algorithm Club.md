# INTEC’s Algorithm Club
Founded in November of 2010 by two graduates from the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo (INTEC), Aronis Mariano y Carlos José Toribio, the club has the purpose of teaching the students from the university and anyone that’s interested the use of algorithm specifically focused on programming.

The club seeks that students learn to utilize logic to solve problems and learn to implement these ideas in a programming language. Besides, for those that don’t have any knowledge in coding, the club is in charge of teaching them slowly until they get to high knowledge in the languages. 

Open every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., the club is available for those that wants to learn algorithm. The students that assist the club are mainly from the careers software engineering, system engineering and cybersecurity engineering, but, students from other careers join the club too.

The two current teachers are: Carlos Joa Fong, the algorithm teacher of INTEC (better known as “The Wave”) and Carlos Toribio, two times representative of the Caribbean for the World Finals of the ACM-ICPC. They are both excellent teachers that instruct without receiving any money, the reason for this is their incredible passion to teach others.

The club mainly focuses in the language “C++” because of its speed to compute, the efficiency in the use of memory and the concepts used might be useful in the future to learn other languages. The club prepares the students for the ACM-ICPC (ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest) that is hosted every year, so that the students are able to solve the problems in the competition. To get this, the students practice with problems from different web pages like “Codeforces” and train with the help of the teachers.
